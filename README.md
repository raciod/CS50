My name is Rachid, and I'm a student from Morocco.

## My CS50 Problem Solving Project

This project is my journey through solving problems from the CS50 course. I am working on tackling various problems and challenges presented in the course, and I'm using a variety of programming languages and tools to come up with solutions.

Feel free to explore this repository to see my progress and solutions. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for joining me on this coding adventure!
